These scripts can become quite useful after you finished CREST runs and wants to do some analysis based on the generated conformer ensemble.

Main functionalities: 
1) file conversion of each conformer into gaussian 16 input file;
2) calculate bond distances/bond angles/dihedrals for each conformer, save values into .txt file, generate and save corresponding scatter plots;
3) calculate RMSD values for each conformer related to the first one (lowest-energy one from CREST), save those data into .txt file.

Example input files and output files are provided as well.
